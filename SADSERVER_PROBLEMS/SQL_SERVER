RESET ROOT PASSWORD OF  SQL  service 


1. Stop the MySQL/MariaDB service first (Stopping the service ensures data consistency 
and prevents any active sessions from interfering with the password reset process.)
Use systemctl or service commands

2. You can also export an environment variable like MYSQLD_OPTS="--skip-grant-tables" before starting the service, which tells the server to use that mode without editing the file permanently. This is handy if you want a one-off bypass without leaving it open.

3. Once you’ve started MariaDB/MySQL with --skip-grant-tables, you can connect without a password using     $ mysql -u root

4. $UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('newpassword') WHERE User='root';
   $FLUSH PRIVILEGES;




BACKUP AND RESTORING   DATABSE FROM BACKUP
To restore a .sql backup file, you’ll use the MySQL command-line client to feed the file’s contents into the server.
The basic syntax is:
$ mysql -u root -p target_database < backup.sql

Creating  backup  from db
You use mysqldump to export a database’s structure and data into a .sql file.

For example:
mysqldump -u root -p source_database > backup.sql

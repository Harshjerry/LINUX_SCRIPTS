find . -type f -readable -exec awk '/secret:/ {print FILENAME}' {} + 2>/dev/null

A spy has left a password in a file in /proc/sys . The contents of the file start with "secret:" (without the quotes).
Find the file and save the word after "secret:" to the file /home/admin/secret.txt with a newline at the end
 (e.g. if the file contents were "secret:password" do: echo "password" > /home/admin/secret.txt).
(Note there's no root/sudo access in this scenario).
